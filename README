CSS, HTML, and Javascript for the image slider was originally sourced from
code examples at https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_image_gallery.asp

this assumes you have a directory structure like:

.
├── components
│   └── slider.js
├── css
│   └── gallery.css
└── images
    └── image01.jpg

1. Copy the gen_project_page.sh script to somewhere in your path, like $HOME/bin/
2. In the current directory, run the script like so:

 gen_project_page.sh > pagename.html
